# Udacity-Data-Wrangling
This project focuses on how to wrangle data. i.e. Gathering, Accessing and Cleaning the data before it is analysed.

## WeRateDogs Twitter Archive
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

The datasets for this project is spread across different file format which will be gathered, accessed for quality and tidiness then cleansed for insightful analysis to be done.
